        <h2>Point At Issue</h2>
        <p>Indifference is the elevating issue of today’s life. It leads to disregard and contradiction in society. There should be an <mark>initiative to provide care</mark> and look after the poor and self reliant people without harming their self-esteem and providing with goods in a reasonable approach.</p>

        <h2>Theory of change</h2>
        <p>Currently, the society is facing indifference and lack of compassion. If we create a platform that provides the needy and deserving clients with their demands like restaurant food and clean water in a low price, provide labour services during house shifting in a reasonable approach with the help of different co-operate sectors. Then, we can create the first step to the ladder of compassion and care in society through our social enterpenurship.</p>

        <h2>Solutions</h2>
        <p>When we talk about care, it’s a broad term. We will be starting with basic steps and expand our project gradually. We will be working both in person and online. Online, we will create an app that will make everyone have access to our platform and clients will be provided with their demands.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We can provide with clean, mineral water in low prices to ensure their self respect and also play our part for the care of society</li>
            <li>Different clients can be contacted and food of restaurant standards can be provided to people from home ensuring their access and hygiene.</li>
            <li>Financial assistance can be provided to families by the help of fund raising and different co-operate sectors</li>
        </ul>
